# WeatherApp
This is a very simplistic weather app in its current state. I plan on making this into a bigger application that can accumulate data and process it in such a way to predict
best fishing spots, conditions, and gear based off data that is recorded from the app.

## Using
To use this app, you must ask me for a google maps api key or provide the app with your own (at the top of index.html, add the api key to the script that makes the call to 
google. Replace {API Key} with your api key.)

If working correctly, it will center on Louisville, CO and have weather data about the boulder area. You can search a new location and it the app will jshow the weather data for
that city.
